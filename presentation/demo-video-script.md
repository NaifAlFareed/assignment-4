# Demo Video Script

**Opening (0:00–0:30)**
Hi, I'm Naif Al-Fareed, a CS student at KFUPM. This is my polished Assignment 4 portfolio—pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Navigation & Accessibility (0:30–1:10)**
Start with the skip link, then show the sticky nav with active-link highlighting. Toggle between light and dark themes; mention focus states and ordered headings.

**Hero & Personalization (1:10–1:50)**
Introduce the hero copy and CTAs. Enter a name in the greeting form, refresh to show the saved message. Point out the session timer tracking time on page.

**Projects (1:50–2:40)**
Use filters (Desktop/University/Web), type in search, and switch sort orders to reorder cards. Expand/collapse project details and mention empty-state handling if nothing matches.

**API Widgets (2:40–4:00)**
- GitHub: Load repos for the default user, change language filter and sort, and show the error message if a fake user is entered.
- Weather: Search a city (e.g., Dhahran), show the temperature/details, and note the saved city.
- Quotes: Refresh for a new quote, save as favorite, and mention local fallback when offline.

**Contact Form (4:00–4:30)**
Enter invalid data to show inline hints, then submit valid data to see the success status. Remind that it's client-side only for the assignment.

**Performance & Docs (4:30–5:00)**
Highlight WebP images, deferred JS, and Lighthouse targets. Point to the README, technical documentation, and AI usage report.

**Closing (5:00–5:15)**
Share the GitHub Pages link and thank viewers. Mention future plans: JSON-driven projects and offline caching.
