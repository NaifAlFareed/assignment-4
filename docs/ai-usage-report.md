# AI Usage Report – Assignment 3

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (GPT-5) via Codex CLI.

## Prompts & Outputs
- Asked for help mapping assignment requirements to concrete features (multi-API ideas, state management, validation).
- Requested wording for documentation sections (README, technical notes) to keep them concise and student-written.
- Sought suggestions for resilient weather + quotes API usage without API keys.

## My Edits & Understanding
- Rewrote all HTML/CSS/JS manually to match my structure and naming.
- Adjusted API error handling, storage keys, and UI text to keep it consistent with my portfolio tone.
- Added my own project cards, session timer, search/sort logic, and layout tweaks after receiving ideas.
- Verified every API endpoint is public/no-key and safe for the assignment.

## Benefits
- Faster brainstorming for advanced features that still fit a student portfolio.
- Clearer documentation phrasing and checklist generation for testing.
- Time saved on mapping weather codes and deciding on quotable endpoints.

## Challenges
- Keeping the UI “student-made” while still polished; required trimming overly formal AI wording.
- Ensuring all new features stayed lightweight without extra libraries.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced combining multiple APIs with client-side state and filters.
- Improved comfort with DOM reordering for search/sort flows without frameworks.
- Strengthened habit of documenting AI involvement transparently.
