# AI Usage Report — Assignment 4

## Tooling
- ChatGPT (GPT-5) via Codex CLI for planning, copy review, refactors, and documentation wording.

## Sessions
### 1) Assignment 4 polish (this submission)
- **Prompt**: Asked Codex to upgrade the A3 portfolio to production quality (semantic layout, theme toggle, spacing/typography cleanup, accessibility/performance targets, docs, and Pages readiness).
- **Output received**: Proposed new HTML structure with meta tags, CSS variable-driven theme system, active-link highlighting, WebP image flow, and doc outlines for README/technical docs/presentation.
- **My edits**: Adjusted copy to keep my voice, rephrased bullets for clarity, tightened spacing scale, swapped bullets to ASCII-only, and rewrote weather/status strings. Chose specific colors, spacing, and clamp values myself after reviewing the suggestions.
- **What I learned**: Sharpened my process for using `data-theme` on `<html>` with CSS variables to avoid layout shifts, and refreshed the habit of pairing smooth scroll with focus management for accessibility.

### 2) Earlier A3 iteration (reference)
- **Prompt**: Brainstormed multi-API ideas (GitHub/weather/quotes), localStorage usage, and documentation wording for Assignment 3.
- **Output received**: Suggestions on API endpoints, validation hints, and doc structure.
- **My edits**: Rebuilt the code to fit my naming/layout, rewrote all copy, and added my own cards/timers.
- **What I learned**: Combining multiple public APIs without keys and coordinating UI filters/sorts in vanilla JS.
